Changes to invoice: This job was to insulate the kitchen double door and the fanlight louvers above the door. The central check was also draught proofed using InvisiSeal. I believe this work is not to be charged for but now gives us the green light to invoice for the job.
Notes: Callum is extremely happy with the install and the noise reduction has meant a much better nights sleep.

Only the en-suite was split. All other splits cancleed by the customer. 1 x sash fastener not required in 11. Bathroom.  Customer is happy with their installation 
Available throughout September.
Good parking. Cutting space should be decent. Lots of F&B colours, mostly matched to our standard CS range but some Pantone in Utility room. Some unusual sashes with very wide astragals and meeting rails. Many MRs tall enough to fit split bars below barrel locks. 1 or 2 will need removing and replacing with key fasteners.

All systems fitted to the glazing bars. Opening sash is screwed on at the top. All windows were washed before installing secondary glazing. New window handles fitted to all windows. Universal Q Lon seal used on the windows rather than Invisiseal but all windows are now sufficiently draught proofed. I met with Alan to have a chat about the work done and he was very happy with how things looked and looked forward to the air pressure test results. He really would like some solid evidence on how effective our system is and what difference it will make. This is to bring to his bosses to prove it works. He is very keen to get the other flats.

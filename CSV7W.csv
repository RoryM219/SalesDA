I also paid a visit to the ball room. We agreed that we draught proof opening windows and seal the ones with gaps that don't open. The centre window's with the arch are to be installed with InvisiTherm. Sides are to be 22 x 8 beading with top and bottom being 16 x 8 beading.

Shutters had to be left operational so Kevin F spoke to Paul's wife and she agreed for us to install without draught proofing, as this would get in the way of the shutters. New non-routed beading had to be painted Almond on site for these systems. 

Side window piano room actually 1200mm wide, not 600mm. Spare sheet used.

Round window on stairwell - customer asked for system to be installed within the deep alcove rather than on the frame. Frame is white; alcove is painted a light green colour.

A few difficult windows with modern shutters or half-shutters in front of them. Some bespoke beading required and some blinds to be moved etc. Shirley decided to go for the Inside-Frame option and get rid of the Simplex systems rather than installing on the staff bead. Lots of condensation and mould in the spare bedroom during the survey visit in January 2022; WHC pre-install please. Kevin D was due to go WC 13.2.22 but couldn’t because of the weather. 
Has a puppy that was 3 months old when I visited in January. Lots of Farrow & Ball colours everywhere including the windows. Used to live on Colonsay and still visits occasionally as one of their children lives up there with their family.

Docs and email sent to Dominic 26.4.22.

There are two documents here:
-	The main document shows all of the work but doesn’t list prices for the re-purposing of the staircase systems. It also notes the InvisiSeal on the front door and maybe elsewhere in the house, which David can identify with you during his walk-round. I’ve applied the same 5% discount to this as you had received in previous quotes. 

-	The second, smaller document shows the prices for repurposing the staircase systems into room 1 and your daughter’s bedroom. 

The total amount payable for this phase of work will be £5,761.18 + £769.80 = £6,530.98. 
Agreed that no charge will be made for InvisiSeal work that needs doing / re-doing.

Client will be in touch after building works have been completed re outstanding windows on survey. Potential learning for surveyors for further inspection/caveats to note when surveying cupolas. RN

28/07/23 The skylight/cupola has a vent system and post install (only 4 weeks ago) there was a lot of debris collecting on the top side of our systems. We think it's either coming from the vent or a broken seal where the bottom of the windows meets the frame/roof. We've agreed to install a 'catcher' around the vent to rule that out, but it would be good to get an assessment whilst on the install. RN

She did mention that the noise of the tugboats was what was causing her the problem when it comes to noise. I mentioned that its extremely difficult to mask the noise of propellers as they vibrate through the ground. I did test the systems by taking them off and listening to car traffic and back on after, and it seems to have done a good job regarding noise from the road. 
There were no tugboats in site at the time of my visit. Some of the plastic finishings had gaps of which were stuck down and sealed in. The biggest issue I found was that the latches for the double-glazed units were in the wrong position. I managed to re install these in the correct position and this has now created more compression which may make some difference to the noise.

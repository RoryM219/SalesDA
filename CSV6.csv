18.04.2023 - Guy Willams went to review the issue there are no problems with the conditions of the window. The condensation is forming on the inside of the Invisitherm system. TE is to contact the customer and review the situation.

DB feels it is due to the position of the curtains.
TE has taken action before

In our bedroom there is condensation on the inside of the double-glazed panel the side next to the room not the side next to the glass window. Also idea to keep the house warm.

07.08.23 Hi Rory,
I will need to create a 5mm x 5mm block beading all the way around each perimeter of each section of the glazing. I will then seal in individual panels ensuring in behind is painted and cleaned. The sealant itself will need to be touched up with paint at the end. 
This process will be quite lengthy mainly because it will be individual panels and with intricate beading which will have to be stuck down using double sided tape and adhesive.
Beading, painting, and washing would be achievable in one day with the sealing in taking another half day. 
Steve, can you please order from the link 6mm x 50m roll of double-sided tape. https://www.vikingtapes.co.uk/products/3m-gpt-020f-double-sided-tape-50mm-x-50m?variant=39488045613119
Also please provide the paint required for the beading and other touch ups.

I attach a photo of one of the windows, showing the type of lifting handle that was fitted with the new Invisitherm glazing. The original windows are sash windows, and the two upstairs windows were fitted with two separate Invisitherm units, so that the windows could still be opened.
The problem is that the draught-proofing has made the sash windows so tight I can't move them at all. Previously they were stiff, but usable. Also, part of the problem seems to be that the new lifting handles (designed to fit between the two panes of glass) do not allow someone of my height or less to develop enough ""lift"" in the right direction. They seemed to work when they were tested by the installers, but I noticed that they were several inches taller, and several decades younger than I am!
Can you ask someone to come and ease the windows for me please SG

Following Michael's visit on Friday, the wind got up and there were some quite strong gusts.  The draught proofing measures certainly made a difference - BUT..
The left hand side window in the living room:  The split bar flexed out and the bottom left corner magnetic strips came apart.  I replaced the elastic hairbands & pieces of bubble wrap that had been plugging the gap round the sash cord and that improved the situation.  Hair bands & bubblewrap are in place in all the other windows.
The hall window:  The split bar flexed out so I have replaced the coaster on the right hand side (between the blind cord cleat and the panels).
There has been a little movement at the splitbar (and some corners) of all the windows.

There were some marks but as usual extremely difficult to see, even with a black background. The scratches are located at the top of the system so when on the window, they are behind some blinds. Interestingly though, they had the systems off recently to have said blinds fitted so whether or not the scratches were done when they had them off for that I couldn't say although they assure me they were careful.

There are 2 types of scratches, 1 looks like it's been wiped with a really dry or slightly dirty cloth so there are lots of really light scratches in an arc. The other looks like a blur or a cloud like formation...in other words there isn't an obvious white blob/scratch that was noticeable by just placing something dark behind it.
